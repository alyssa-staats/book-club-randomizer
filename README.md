# book-club-randomizer
A script and sample dataset to randomize your book club's selection

This is a very simple R script to randomize your book club's book choice. It works in two phases: (1) choosing a person randomly, and then
(2) choosing a book randomly that is attached to the chosen person.

I'm also attaching the dataset used. Don't judge us for our book choices. At least we're reading.

Finally, take note that all the people in the spreadsheet will be considered eligible for selection. I would need to make an update to filter
out based on prior choices, and since I don't use this anymore really it doesn't seem worth it.

Anyways contact me if you have questions. I don't claim that this is very good. I just thought it was kind of funny.
